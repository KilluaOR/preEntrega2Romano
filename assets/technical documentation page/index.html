    <p>A <code>mode</code> in music is one of several ways of ordering the notes of a scale according to the intervals they form with the tonic, thus providing a theoretical framework for the melody. It is the vocabulary of a melody; it specifies which notes can be used and indicates which have special importance. Of these, there are two principal notes: the final, on which the melody ends, and the dominant, which is the secondary centre.</p>

        <h2>Ancient Greek Modes</h2>
        </header>

      <p>The modes of Greek antiquity were placed by theorists in orderly fashion within a larger context. Although the modes were a series of <code>seven-note diatonic scales</code> (i.e., containing five whole tones and two semitones), the nucleus of the tone system was the <code>tetrachord</code>—a group of four consecutive notes comprising the interval of a fourth. Except in late antiquity, the notes were always arranged in a descending order, the basic tetrachord consisting of two whole tones and one semitone: E–D–C–B. Two such tetrachords, separated from one another by a whole tone, formed the so-called Greek <a href="#Dorian-Mode">Dorian mode</a>: E–D–C–B A–G–F–E. The Dorian mode was taken as a basis for the construction of the larger system. Its single-octave range was extended by the addition of a third tetrachord, A–G–F–E, on top and of a fourth tetrachord, E–D–C–B, at the bottom. In contrast to the two inner tetrachords, which were separated by a whole tone, each outer tetrachord was linked with the neighbouring inner one by a shared note:</br>

A G F E D C B A G F E D C B.</br>

</p>
      <p>Because the combination of the four tetrachords yielded a range of two octaves minus one whole tone, a low A was added by theorists to achieve the following <code>diatonic two-octave system</code>: A G F E D C B A G F E D C B A. This two-octave row, or disdiapason, was called the <code>Greater Perfect System</code>. It was analyzed as consisting of seven overlapping scales, or octave species, called harmoniai, characterized by the different positions of their semitones.</p>

        <h3>Hypodorian</h3></header>

        <p>         <li><code class="subtitle"><b>Historical Context</b></code></br>
It was derived from the Dorian mode but is slightly lower in pitch, hence the prefix “hypo-” meaning “under.”</li>
<li><code class="subtitle"><b>Musical Structure
Scale</b></code></br>
The mode's characteristic is based on the interval pattern of whole and half steps. In modern notation, it follows the pattern of a natural minor scale:</br>

A - B - C - D - E - F - G - A</br>

<code class="subtitle"><u>Intervals</u>:</code>
Whole step, Half step, Whole step, Whole step, Half step, Whole step, Whole step.</li>

<li><code class="subtitle"><b>Ethos and Character</b></code></br>
In Greek philosophy, different modes were thought to evoke specific emotions or states of mind. The Hypodorian mode was considered to have a serious, calming, and stabilizing character.</li>
<li><code class="subtitle"><b>Modern Equivalents</b></code></br>
The Hypodorian mode is roughly equivalent to the Aeolian mode in medieval and modern Western music theory, which corresponds to the natural minor scale.</li>

        <section class="main-section" id="Hypophrygian">
   <header><h3>Hypophrygian</h3></header>

          <p>
            <li><code class="subtitle"><b>Historical Context</b></code></li>
The Hypophrygian mode is derived from the Phrygian mode, just as the Hypodorian is derived from the Dorian. The prefix "hypo-" means "below" or "under," indicating it is a lower-pitched counterpart of the Phrygian mode.

<li><code class="subtitle"><b>Musical Structure</b></code></li>
In modern terms, the Hypophrygian mode can be represented as starting on B in a sequence of natural notes:</br>

B - C - D - E - F - G - A - B</br>

<u>Intervals</u>:
Half step, Whole step, Whole step, Whole step, Half step, Whole step, Whole step.</br>
The mode follows a half step between the first and second notes, giving it a distinctive flavor that differs from the minor scales in later Western music.

<li><code class="subtitle"><b>Ethos and Character</b></code></li>
The Hypophrygian mode was associated with emotional and often plaintive or melancholic qualities. As we've mentioned the ancient Greeks attributed specific psychological and emotional effects to each mode, and the Hypophrygian was thought to evoke softness or lament.
<li><code class="subtitle"><b>Modern Equivalent</b></code></li>
In modern music theory, the Hypophrygian mode aligns with the Locrian mode, which also starts on the note B and features the same pattern of intervals, though the Locrian mode is generally not common in Western music because of its unstable tonality (due to the diminished fifth).

          <section class="main-section" id="Hypolydian">
   <header><h3>Hypolydian</h3></header>

            <p><li><code class="subtitle"><b>Historical Context</b></code></li>
The Hypolydian mode is derived from the Lydian mode, but it starts lower on the scale.
It was one of the primary harmoniai used in Greek music, and the prefix "hypo-" indicates that it lies below the standard Lydian mode.

<li><code class="subtitle"><b>Musical Structure</b></code></li>
The Hypolydian mode can be represented by a scale starting on F using the natural notes in modern notation:</br>

F - G - A - B♭ - C - D - E - F</br>

<u>Intervals:</u>

Whole step, Whole step, Half step, Whole step, Whole step, Whole step, Half step.</br>
In terms of intervals, the Hypolydian mode follows a similar pattern to the modern major scale, but with a lowered fourth (B♭ instead of B), giving it a distinct sound.

<li><code class="subtitle"><b>Ethos and Character</b></code></li>
The Hypolydian mode was associated with softer, more soothing, or contemplative qualities. The Hypolydian was seen as gentle and sometimes even tender.
<li><code><b>Modern Equivalent</b></code></li>
In medieval and Renaissance music theory, the Hypolydian mode evolved into a mode that would correspond with the Ionian mode, which is essentially the modern major scale. However, because of the flat fourth (B♭), it retains a more specific Lydian flavor in ancient Greek music theory.</p>

          <section class="main-section" id="Dorian">
   <header id="Dorian-Mode"><h3>Dorian</h3></header>

            <p>
              <li><code class="subtitle"><b>Historical Context</b></code></li>
The Dorian mode is named after the Dorian people of ancient Greece. It was considered the "authentic" version of its corresponding lower-pitched counterpart, the Hypodorian mode.</br>
In Greek philosophy, the Dorian mode was associated with strength, stability, and discipline, which made it suitable for warriors and statesmen.
<li><code class="subtitle"><b>Musical Structure</b></code></li>
In modern terms, the Dorian mode can be represented by a scale starting on D in the sequence of natural notes:</br>

D - E - F - G - A - B - C - D</br>

<u>Intervals</u>:

Whole step, Half step, Whole step, Whole step, Whole step, Half step, Whole step.</br>
The key characteristic of the Dorian mode is the natural sixth (B in this case), which differentiates it from the natural minor scale (which has a lowered sixth).

<li><code class="subtitle"><b>Ethos and Character</b></code></li>
In ancient Greek thought, the Dorian mode was associated with nobility, bravery, and moral fortitude. Platon, for instance, believed that the Dorian mode was suitable for cultivating a balanced and virtuous character.</br>
This association with strength and order contrasts with other modes that were thought to evoke more emotional, melancholic, or exotic qualities.
<li><code class="subtitle"><b>Modern Use</b></code></li>
The Dorian mode has been absorbed into later Western music theory, where it appears as one of the church modes in medieval music. It remains widely used in modern music, especially in jazz, folk, and rock.
In the context of modern music, the Dorian mode is commonly associated with a minor scale but with a more "uplifting" feel due to its raised sixth note.d</p>

   <header><h3>Phrygian</h3></header>

         <p>
              <li><code class="subtitle"><b>Hsitorical Content</b></code></li>
              The Phrygian mode is one of the ancient Greek musical modes, and in modern Western music, it refers to one of the seven diatonic modes derived from the major scale. The mode is named after the ancient Phrygians, a people who lived in what is now modern-day Turkey. In ancient Greek theory, the Phrygian mode had different connotations than it does today, but both forms share a similar sound and scale structure.

<li><code class="subtitle"><b>Musical Structure</b></code></li>
<u>Scale formula</u>: In the modern sense, the Phrygian mode can be described as a major scale starting from its third degree. In terms of intervals, it is:<br>

Root - Minor second - Minor third - Perfect fourth - Perfect fifth - Minor sixth - Minor seventh<br>
For example, if you start on E and play the notes of the C major scale (C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C), you get the E Phrygian mode:<br>

E - F - G - A - B - C - D - E<br>
<li><code class="subtitle"><b>Sound</b></code></li>
The Phrygian mode has a dark, exotic, and somewhat tense or "Eastern" sound, largely due to the presence of the minor second interval between the first and second scale degrees.<br>
In comparison with other minor modes, like Aeolian (natural minor), the Phrygian mode feels more unstable because of the half-step between the root and the second note.
<li><code class="subtitle"><b>Ancient Greek Phrygian Mode</b></code></li>
In ancient Greek music, modes (harmoniai) were tied to cultural and ethical ideas. The Phrygian mode was considered energetic and exciting, possibly even associated with religious rituals involving ecstasy or enthusiasm.
<li><code class="subtitle"><b>Use in Modern Music</b></code></li>
The Phrygian mode is frequently used in various musical genres, especially in flamenco, metal, and other styles that draw on Mediterranean and Middle Eastern tonalities.<br>
Composers and musicians use it to evoke a sense of tension, drama, or exoticism. For example, flamenco music heavily employs the Phrygian mode to achieve its characteristic sound.</p>

              <li><code class="subtitle"><b>Historical Content</b></code></li>
              The Lydian mode is another one of the ancient Greek musical modes, which also has a significant place in modern Western music theory. It has a bright, uplifting, and somewhat ethereal sound, and its history is as rich as its tonal character.

<li><code class="subtitle"><b>Lydian Mode in Ancient Greek Music</b></code></li>
<u>Ancient Greek mode</u>: In ancient Greece, the Lydian mode (named after the region of Lydia in Anatolia) was part of the harmoniai system, like the Phrygian mode. Each mode was believed to have a specific emotional or ethical impact. The Lydian mode was often considered to have a more cheerful, light, and graceful character.<br>
<u>Structure</u>: Greek modes were based on tetrachords, and the Lydian tetrachord was built on two whole tones followed by a semitone. When combined into a full octave, it gave a brighter and more open sound than the Phrygian or Dorian modes.
<li><code class="subtitle"><b>Lydian Mode in Modern Western Music</b></code></li>
In modern Western theory, the Lydian mode is essentially a major scale with a raised fourth degree. This sharp fourth gives the Lydian mode its characteristic bright and almost "floating" sound.<br>

<u>Formula</u>: The Lydian mode follows this interval pattern:<br>

1 (root) – 2 – 3 – #4 – 5 – 6 – 7 – 1<br>
The raised fourth degree is the unique feature of this mode compared to the major (Ionian) scale, which has a natural fourth.

<li><code class="subtitle"><b>Characteristics</b></code></li>
The Lydian mode is bright, uplifting, and ethereal, with a dreamy quality.<br>
The sharp fourth creates a sense of tension and movement, but not in a dark way like the Phrygian mode; instead, it's more of a suspended, unresolved brightness.<br>
Often associated with themes of innocence, wonder, or the cosmic in Western music.
<li><code class="subtitle"><b>Usage in Music</b></code></li>
<u>Classical music</u>: Composers like Béla Bartók, Debussy, and Sibelius have used the Lydian mode to evoke a sense of expansion and light.<br>
<u>Film scores</u>: The Lydian mode is a favorite in film music for creating a sense of wonder and optimism. A classic example is John Williams’ use of the Lydian mode in the theme for E.T. and parts of Star Wars.<br>
<u>Jazz and rock</u>: In jazz and rock, the Lydian mode is used for its unique sound, adding color to compositions and improvisation.</p>

          <section class="main-section" id="Mixolydian">
            <header><h3>Mixolydian</h3></header>

            <p><li><code class="subtitle"><b>Historical Context</b></code></li>
In ancient Greek music, the term "Mixolydian" referred to a different mode than what we use in modern music theory. The Greek Mixolydian was likely a scale that sounded more like the modern natural minor (Aeolian) mode or even the Dorian mode. Over time, the term was adapted to the current Mixolydian mode in the context of the Western diatonic system.
<li><code class="subtitle"><b>Musical Structure Scale</b></code></li> 
The Mixolydian mode is essentially a major scale with a lowered seventh note. It follows this pattern of whole (W) and half (H) steps:<br>

W - W - H - W - W - H - W<br>
<u>Intervals</u>: Root, major second, major third, perfect fourth, perfect fifth, major sixth, minor seventh.

<li><code class="subtitle"><b>Modern use</b></code></li>
The Mixolydian mode is quite popular in rock, jazz, blues, and folk music, as the flattened seventh gives it a slightly bluesy or folksy feel. It's often used over dominant seventh chords (e.g., G7 in the key of C major), where that flat seventh note creates a natural fit with the chord structure.</p>
